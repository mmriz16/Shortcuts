# Shortcuts.design — Every shortcuts for designers, centralized and searchable.
## Introduction
Hi, I'm [Miftakhul Rizky](https://redma.my.id), the creator of [Redma Shortcuts](https://shortcut.redma.my.id). Redma Shortcut lists every shortcut for designers in one place and in a simple and clear way. It's a centralized and searchable online database that helps over 10K designers every month to quickly charge their workflow. Whether you're a beginning designer looking to work more efficient, when you switched to a new designtool or when you just want a reference to see which shortcut to use for that action you have to do all day long, it'll help you get there.
